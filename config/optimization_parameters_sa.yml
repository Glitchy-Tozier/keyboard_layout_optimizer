### Initial temperature
# Should be about 150. Commas are allowed (150.42).
# Set to 0 (or a negative number) if a greedy algorithm is preferred.
# If you want the optimizer to calculate the starting-temperature for you, use one of the following:
# init_temp: null
# init_temp: 
# init_temp: ~
init_temp: 150

# Swap out this many keys-pairs on every iteration.
# For simulated annealing it's best to keep the variation between iterations
# as small as possible. Thus, one single swap may be best.
key_switches: 1

### Parameters for the solver.
# Stop if there was no accepted solution after this many iterations
stall_accepted: 5000

### Parameters for the [Executor].
# Set maximum number of iterations (defaults to `std::u64::MAX`)
max_iters: 100000
